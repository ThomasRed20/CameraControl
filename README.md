A simple UI to resolve the problem of mass changing scene files on Panasonic PTZ Cameras. Groups can be added of cameras to simplify the process of switching into a day/night/IR mode, configured on Scene File 1, 2 & 3.

To install, clone from githutb, and run npm install on a machine with internet to get the relevant node modules. If the machine has no internet access, do this on another machine, and copy to the deployment machine.

Currently, add cameras using the CLI built into the program.
